# SevenfoldStudy
SevenfoldStudy – AI‑driven generator of seven meditative Q&amp;A prompts per Bible chapter, guiding you to cross‑verse reflection.
Extended Project Description (for README.md):

SevenfoldStudy is a Python‑based AI agent that helps deepen your Bible study by producing seven thoughtfully crafted questions and answers for any given chapter. Each question is designed to:

    Encourage personal meditation and spiritual growth

    Draw connections between the chapter at hand and other passages across Scripture

    Spark insights through cross‑referencing key themes, symbols, and teachings

Under the hood, SevenfoldStudy:

    Loads chapter text from a local JSON Bible source

    Uses the OpenAI API (GPT‑4‑turbo) with a custom prompt to generate meditative Q&A pairs

    Outputs structured JSON for easy integration into web apps, devotionals, or study tools

Whether you’re an individual reader, a small‑group leader, or building a devotional app, SevenfoldStudy helps you and your community linger longer in God’s Word—and discover fresh reflections with every chapter.
